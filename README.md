This repository contains the Custom [Keyboard Maestro](http://www.keyboardmaestro.com/main/) scripts that I've found to be useful:

I made most of the below scripts with the guidance of the super helpful members at KM's [official yahoo group](http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/keyboard_maestro/).

# INSTALLATION

go to Keyboard Maestro > File > Import Macros...

some of the scripts are application specific, so i suggest you create a new group for these and assign them to the respective applications.
